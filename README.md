### Lyspace
Shows "Live Now" badge on a YouTube video when they are live on YouTube or Twitch. It uses credits in the YouTube description to get their
Twitch profile.

Some channels like [Trackmania Esports Clips](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQyQH65dJua3PzEEEOsQlEg)
which posts clips from so many stream sources with attribution will have a "Live Now" badge for streamers
featured in the video, which is kinda cool.
